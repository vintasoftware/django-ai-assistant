# Django AI Assistant :material-robot-happy-outline:

Combine the power of Large Language Models with Django's productivity to build intelligent applications.

Regardless of the feasibility of AGI, AI assistants are a new paradigm for computation.
AI agents and assistants allow devs to easily build applications that make smart decisions.

The latest LLMs from major AI providers have a "killer feature" called Tool Calling,
which enables AI models to call methods from Django's side, and essentially
do anything a Django view can, such as DB queries, file management, external API calls, etc.

While users commonly interact with LLMs via conversations, AI Assistants can do a lot with any kind of string input, including JSON.
Your end users won't even realize that a LLM is doing the heavy-lifting behind the scenes!
Some ideas for innovative AI assistants include:

- A movie recommender chatbot that helps users manage their movie backlogs
- An autofill button for forms of your application
- Tailored email reminders that consider users' activity
- A real-time tourist guide that recommends attractions given the user's current location

We provide examples for some of those applications. [Get Started](get-started.md) now!
