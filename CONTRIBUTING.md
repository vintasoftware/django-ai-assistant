# Contributing

We can always use your help to improve Django AI Assistant! Please feel free to tackle existing [issues](https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-ai-assistant/issues). If you have a new idea, please create a thread on [Discussions](https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-ai-assistant/discussions).

Please follow this guide to learn more about how to develop and test the project locally, before opening a pull request.

## Local Dev Setup

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vintasoftware/django-ai-assistant.git
```

### Install development tools

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency and virtual environment management.

If you need to install the version of Python recommended for the project, you can use [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

For installing Node, we recommend [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Install dependencies

#### Backend

Go to the project root. To instantiate the virtual environment, run

```bash
poetry shell
```

Install the Python dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

If you encounter an error regarding the Python version required for the project, you can use pyenv to install the appropriate version based on [.python-version](https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-ai-assistant/blob/main/.python-version):

```bash
pyenv install
```

#### Frontend

Go to the frontend directory and install the Node dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
```

### Install pre-commit hooks

```bash
pre-commit install
```

It's critical to run the pre-commit hooks before pushing your code to follow the project's code style, and avoid linting errors.

### Updating the OpenAPI schema

It's critical to update the OpenAPI schema when you make changes to the `django_ai_assistant/api/views.py` or related files:

```bash
poetry run python manage.py generate_openapi_schema --output frontend/openapi_schema.json
sh -c 'cd frontend && pnpm run generate-client'
```

### Developing with the example project

Run the frontend project in `build:watch` mode:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm run build:watch
```

Go to the example project, install the dependencies, and link the frontend project:

```bash
cd ..  # back to project root directory
cd example
pnpm install
pnpm remove django-ai-assistant-client  # remove the distributed package to use the local one
pnpm link ../frontend
```

Then follow the instructions in the [example README](https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-ai-assistant/tree/main/example#running) to run the example project.

## Tests

Before running tests copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.tests`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.tests
```

Run tests with:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

The tests use `pytest-vcr` to record and replay HTTP requests to AI models.

If you're implementing a new test that needs to call a real AI model, you need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with a real API key in the `.env.tests` file.

Then, you will run the tests in record mode:

```bash
poetry run pytest --record-mode=once
```

To run frontend tests:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm run test
```

## Documentation

We use [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to generate the documentation from markdown files.
Check the files in the `docs` directory.

To run the documentation locally, you need to run:

```bash
poetry run mkdocs serve
```

## Release

!!! info
    The backend and the frontend are versioned together, that is, they should have the same version number.

To release and publish a new version, follow these steps:

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`, `frontend/package.json` and `example/package.json`.
2. Re-install the local version of the Python project: `poetry install`
3. In the project root, run `poetry run python manage.py generate_openapi_schema --output frontend/openapi_schema.json` to update the OpenAPI schema.
4. Re-install the local version of the frontend project:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

5. In the frontend directory, run `pnpm run generate-client` to update the TypeScript client with the new OpenAPI schema.
6. Update the changelog in `CHANGELOG.md`.
7. Open a PR with the changes.
8. Once the PR is merged, run the [Release GitHub Action](https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-ai-assistant/actions/workflows/release.yml) to create a draft release.
9. Review the draft release, ensure the description has at least the associated changelog entry, and publish it.
10. Once the review is published, the [Publish GitHub Action](https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-ai-assistant/actions/workflows/publish.yml) will automatically run to publish the new version to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/django-ai-assistant) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/django-ai-assistant-client). Check the logs to ensure the publication was successful.
